  This document is a combination of rules and guidance in order to help you manage your apprenticeship in partnership with your chosen main provider. This summary checklist is a guide to the steps you must take to ensure you are meeting the apprenticeship funding rules. 

### Do I have a genuine job for this apprentice?

By genuine we mean that: 

* the apprentice must have a contract of service with you, or an apprenticeship training
agency, which is long enough for them to complete the apprenticeship successfully
(including, for standards the end-point assessment). Exceptions to this can be found in
paragraph E15

* the cost of the apprenticeâ€™s wages must be met by you

* the apprentice must have a job role (or roles) with you that provides the opportunity for them to gain the knowledge, skills and behaviours needed to achieve their apprenticeship

* the apprentice must have appropriate support and supervision on the job, by you, to
carry out their job role

### Have I checked the eligibility of the apprentice?
